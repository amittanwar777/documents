# 🧮 Comparison: Init Container Strategy vs. Bundled Artifact in Base Image

## 📌 Overview

This document compares two approaches for managing application artifacts and enabling base image evergreening in OpenShift/Kubernetes deployments:

1. **Init Container Strategy** – artifacts delivered separately via an init container.
2. **Bundled Artifact Strategy** – artifacts are bundled into the main base image.

## 🔍 Comparison Table

| Feature / Concern                    | **Init Container Strategy**                                     | **Bundled Artifact in Base Image**                              |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Basic Approach**                   | Artifact image is a separate init container. Artifacts are copied into a shared volume (`emptyDir`). | Application binaries/artifacts are pre-bundled into the main container image. |
| **Artifact and Runtime Separation** | ✅ Fully separated – artifact and runtime are independent        | ❌ Tightly coupled – artifact and runtime live in one image      |
| **Image Ownership**                 | Dev team owns artifact image; Ops owns base runtime              | Usually one team maintains the whole image                       |
| **Base Image Evergreen Capable?**   | ✅ Yes – update base image independently by just changing the runtime image | ⚠️ Limited – must rebuild full image with artifacts every time  |
| **Artifact Update Workflow**        | Rebuild only the init container image                           | Must rebuild entire image (artifact + base)                     |
| **Base Image Patch Workflow**       | Rebuild base runtime image and rollout                          | Rebuild full image with updated base and artifacts              |
| **CI/CD Pipeline Separation**       | ✅ Separate pipelines for artifact and base images               | ❌ Single pipeline for all layers                                |
| **Runtime Startup Time**            | Slightly slower (copying files via init container)              | Slightly faster (everything already present)                    |
| **Rollout Simplicity**              | Moderate – two images involved                                  | ✅ Simple – single image to rollout                              |
| **Security Compliance (e.g. CVE Fixes)** | ✅ Patch base and redeploy                                     | ⚠️ Rebuild entire image, even for small base change             |
| **Image Size**                      | Slightly smaller runtime image (no artifacts)                   | Larger combined image                                           |
| **Debugging/Testing**               | Easier to test runtime separately                               | Testing must cover full image build                             |
| **Flexibility Across Environments** | ✅ Can mix/match artifact with different runtime bases           | ❌ Less flexible – need separate images per environment          |
| **Best For**                        | Large teams, CI/CD, secure environments, GitOps                 | Small apps, tightly managed environments                        |

## 🟩 Example Use Cases

### ✅ Init Container Strategy is better when:
- You need to **patch base images frequently** (e.g. CVEs every month).
- Artifacts change less frequently than runtime base.
- You prefer **separation of duties** (Dev vs Ops).
- You follow **GitOps** or have **security compliance** needs.

### ✅ Bundled Artifact Strategy is better when:
- You prefer simplicity with **single image pipelines**.
- Your app is **small, fast-changing**, or tightly owned.
- You want the **fastest container startup time**.
- You don't need complex update/patch logic.

| Artifacts stored in              | Separate init image        | Main application image     |

## 🧠 Final Recommendation

- ✅ Use **Init Container Strategy** for:
  - **Security-driven environments**
  - **CVE patch agility**
  - **CI/CD flexibility**
  - **Multi-team ownership**

- ✅ Use **Bundled Artifact Strategy** for:
  - **Simple apps or monolithic CI pipelines**
  - **Low patch frequency**
  - **Minimal environments with fewer moving parts**
