I am writing to request an extension of my Work From Home arrangement due to a critical medical situation in my immediate family.
My [relationship, e.g., wife/mother] has been diagnosed with Metastatic Paraganglioma Syndrome (malignant cancer). She underwent abdominal surgery in April, and metastatic lesions have also been identified in the lungs. She received her first cycle of PRRT therapy from AIIMS in August, and further treatment is required.
Recently, her condition has worsened, with a rapid increase in a bilateral carotid body tumor affecting the neck. After consultations with multiple leading medical institutes across India, we have been informed that only SCTIMST, Trivandrum has the capability to perform the required complex surgery. This surgery involves a multidisciplinary team including head & neck, vascular, neuro, and maxillofacial surgeons, and carries significant post-operative risks, including potential cranial nerve injuries.
The tentative surgery date provided by the hospital is January, following which she will require intensive care, including tube-based nutrition and continuous family support. If she recovers sufficiently, a second cycle of PRRT therapy from AIIMS will be required to control further metastatic progression.
Given the critical nature of this phase and the need for my constant presence and support, I sincerely request an extension of my Work From Home arrangement. I assure you that I will continue to fulfill my professional responsibilities to the best of my ability during this period.
I would be grateful for your understanding and support at this difficult time. Please let me know if any additional documentation or discussion is required.
Thank you for your consideration.
