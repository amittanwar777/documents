I am pleased to inform you that we have successfully addressed the issue of Tomcat and JBoss instances not automatically starting after a machine restart. By creating and configuring systemd services for these instances, we have ensured that they now automatically come back online following a reboot.

This improvement enhances the reliability and uptime of our applications. Please let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
