h1. Jenkins Pipeline Documentation: Deploying Nginx on OpenShift v4

h2. Introduction
This document provides a detailed guide to set up and execute a Jenkins pipeline for deploying Nginx on OpenShift v4. This includes the necessary configurations, pipeline stages, and verification steps.

h2. Prerequisites
* Jenkins server with the following plugins installed:
  * [Pipeline Plugin|https://plugins.jenkins.io/workflow-aggregator/]
  * [OpenShift Client Plugin|https://plugins.jenkins.io/openshift-client/]
* Access to OpenShift v4 with necessary permissions for deploying resources.
* Nginx deployment YAML files (or reference to the location of these files in your repository).

h2. Pipeline Overview
This Jenkins pipeline automates the deployment of Nginx on OpenShift v4. The main stages are:
* *Build Stage*: Sets up Nginx image or necessary dependencies.
* *Deploy Stage*: Deploys Nginx to the specified OpenShift project.
* *Verification*: Confirms successful deployment.

h2. Step-by-Step Guide

h3. Stage 1: Jenkins Job Setup
# Open Jenkins and create a new pipeline job for Nginx deployment.
# Configure the pipeline with the following parameters:
  * *Pipeline script*: Configure the pipeline script to include stages for building and deploying to OpenShift.

h3. Stage 2: Pipeline Script
Below is the Jenkins pipeline script used for deploying Nginx. Adjust the OpenShift project name, Nginx image details, and other variables as needed.

{code:language=groovy|title=Jenkins Pipeline Script}
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building Nginx...'
                // Add any build steps here
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy to OpenShift') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Example OpenShift CLI command
                    sh 'oc apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml -n <YOUR_PROJECT>'
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
{code}

h3. Stage 3: OpenShift Deployment
Once the pipeline script is configured, initiate the pipeline run. This will trigger the stages defined above, leading to an Nginx deployment on OpenShift.

h2. Verifying Deployment
To confirm that Nginx is deployed:
# Access the OpenShift console and navigate to the project.
# Verify the pod status by checking the *Pods* section.
# Alternatively, run the following command to view pod status:
{code:language=bash|title=Check Pod Status}
oc get pods -n <YOUR_PROJECT>
{code}

{note}
Insert screenshots of OpenShift console or command-line output to show successful deployment.

h2. Common Issues & Troubleshooting
* *Issue*: Pipeline fails at the deployment stage.
  * *Solution*: Verify OpenShift permissions and that the Nginx YAML file is accessible.
* *Issue*: Nginx service is not accessible post-deployment.
  * *Solution*: Check the route configuration in OpenShift and confirm the service is exposed.

h2. Conclusion
This pipeline enables seamless deployment of Nginx on OpenShift v4 using Jenkins, streamlining the process and ensuring consistent deployments.
