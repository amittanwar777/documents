I’d like to share an update regarding my spouse’s health, as she is currently dealing with Multifocal Metastatic Paraganglioma Syndrome.

1. She underwent abdominal surgery for retroperitoneal paraganglioma removal on 28th April. Her recovery is ongoing, as her weight had dropped to a very low level.


2. We are now awaiting the next surgery (neck area), but her condition remains critical due to her current health status.


3. We had also visited Tata Memorial Hospital to explore radiation therapy options. However, since her case is not a textbook one, we are currently reviewing our decision based on her evolving health condition.


4. The case is under early-stage discussion at AIIMS Delhi, and the ENT team is involved for broader evaluation due to its complexity.



Attached documents include:

Discharge summary from the abdominal surgery

Clinical physician’s note to AIIMS

ENT department’s workup report from AIIMS


Given the situation, my presence is essential to provide continuous physical and emotional support to my spouse during this difficult time.

I kindly request your support in allowing me to work from home long-term from Jaipur. I remain fully committed to fulfilling all my professional responsibilities without any compromise in productivity or availability.
