I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to request a dispensation to continue working remotely for an extended period. As my wife's maternity leave is ending in September, it would greatly benefit my family if I could remain in my hometown to support her and our newborn child.

I understand the importance of being physically present in the office, but given the circumstances and the need for ongoing care, I believe that working remotely is a viable option. I am committed to maintaining productivity and communication through regular check-ins, video conferences, and being available during core business hours.

I would greatly appreciate your consideration and the opportunity to discuss this further. Please let me know if there is any additional information or arrangements needed to support this request.

Thank you for your understand

Dear [Supervisor/Manager's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to discuss an important matter regarding my work situation. As you may know, I have been working remotely due to the ongoing pandemic and the recent birth of my child. As my wife's maternity leave will end in September, I would like to request a dispensation to continue working from my home town for an extended period of time.

First and foremost, I want to express my gratitude for the support and understanding the company has shown during this transitional period.

It has been an invaluable opportunity for me to bond with my family during these early months, which I believe has positively impacted my overall well-being and work performance.

Given the circumstances and considering the well-being of my family, I would like to propose a plan that would allow me to continue working remotely until a suitable arrangement can be made for my return to the office. I understand the importance of being physically present at the workplace, and I am committed to finding a solution that works for both my personal situation and the company's needs.

To ensure a smooth transition, I am willing to take any necessary steps to ensure continued productivity and collaboration with the team. I will make myself available for regular check-ins and meetings via video conferencing tools, maintain consistent communication through email and other








Support for Maternity Care

Dear [Supervisor/Manager's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to discuss a matter of utmost importance regarding the support and care required for my wife and newborn baby after her maternity leave ends on September 19th.

As you are aware, I have been working remotely from my hometown since [date] due to the circumstances surrounding the ongoing pandemic. During this time, I have been able to balance my work responsibilities effectively while being readily available to assist my wife during her maternity leave.

However, with the approaching end of her maternity leave, I am faced with a challenging situation.

This would allow me to remain in my hometown and support my wife as she returns to work and adapts to the demands of being a new mother.

During this temporary dispensation, I assure you that I will continue to maintain regular communication and prioritize the completion of my assigned tasks. I am confident that with the technological resources available to us, I can continue to contribute effectively to the team's objectives while being present for my family's needs.

I understand that this request may require some adjustments to the existing work arrangements, and I am open to discussing potential solutions that would ensure a smooth transition for both the team and me. I am willing to provide any additional information or clarification you may require to consider this request.

I deeply appreciate your understanding and support in this matter. By allowing me this dispensation, not only will it enable me to fulfill my personal responsibilities, but it will also contribute to my overall well-being, job satisfaction, and subsequent productivity.

Thank you for your attention to this request. I look forward to discussing this further with you and finding a mutually beneficial resolution.
