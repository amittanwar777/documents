I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to request a dispensation to continue working remotely for an extended period. As my wife's maternity leave is ending in September, it would greatly benefit my family if I could remain in my hometown to support her and our newborn child.

I understand the importance of being physically present in the office, but given the circumstances and the need for ongoing care, I believe that working remotely is a viable option. I am committed to maintaining productivity and communication through regular check-ins, video conferences, and being available during core business hours.

I would greatly appreciate your consideration and the opportunity to discuss this further. Please let me know if there is any additional information or arrangements needed to support this request.

Thank you for your understand

Dear [Supervisor/Manager's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to discuss an important matter regarding my work situation. As you may know, I have been working remotely due to the ongoing pandemic and the recent birth of my child. As my wife's maternity leave will end in September, I would like to request a dispensation to continue working from my home town for an extended period of time.

Working remotely has allowed me to actively participate in the care of my newborn child while maintaining my work responsibilities effectively. It has been an invaluable opportunity for me to bond with my family during these early months, which I believe has positively impacted my overall well-being and work performance.

Given the circumstances and considering the well-being of my family, I would like to propose a plan that would allow me to continue working remotely until a suitable arrangement can be made for my return to the office. I understand the importance of being physically present at the workplace, and I am committed to finding a solution that works for both my personal situation and the company's needs.

To ensure a smooth transition, I am willing to take any necessary steps to ensure continued productivity and collaboration with the team. I will make myself available for regular check-ins and meetings via video conferencing tools, maintain consistent communication through email and other
