Self-Review: Migration from Legacy OpenShift v3 to AWS

Overview: In the project focused on migrating Digital Shared Services (DSS) from the legacy OpenShift v3 platform to AWS, I played a crucial role in its successful completion. This migration ensured that all DSS features are now available on AWS for both production and non-production environments, achieving a 100% migration completion rate.

Key Contributions:

1. Migration Execution and Coordination:

Actively contributed to the migration planning, coordinating with multiple teams to ensure a seamless transition to AWS.

Led efforts to address challenges associated with the migration, utilizing my technical expertise to troubleshoot and resolve issues in real time.



2. Ensuring Feature Continuity:

Worked to ensure that all 55 DSS features were fully migrated to AWS, maintaining feature functionality and performance.

Helped document the process, providing a detailed record of the migration, which serves as a valuable reference for future migrations.



3. Stakeholder Collaboration and Communication:

Collaborated with stakeholders to keep them informed of progress and address any concerns, ensuring alignment and transparency.

Contributed to the overall goal of supporting multiple Customer Journey Labs, which included seven pods and multiple sub-pods, by helping establish a reliable AWS-based infrastructure.




Importance of the Project: This migration to AWS is a significant milestone for DSS, improving operational efficiency, reducing risk, and supporting scalability. By moving from a legacy system to AWS, we also address potential customer impact risks, avoid unplanned operational costs, and support the Tier 1 milestone, which is essential for meeting high-performance standards.

Conclusion: My contributions to this project have not only strengthened my skills in AWS and migration processes but also underscored the value of teamwork and effective communication. I am proud of the role I played in achieving a successful 100% migration and look forward to applying these insights to future initiatives within the DevOps domain.
