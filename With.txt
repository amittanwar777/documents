Values and Leadership Behavior:

I consistently demonstrate a commitment to efficiency, collaboration, and innovation in my work. In the Digital Shared Services projects, I focus on streamlining processes through automation, ensuring high availability, and simplifying deployment for clients. My leadership in designing security principles and implementing clear processes reflects a proactive approach to problem-solving.

In Private Banking, I take the lead by providing real-time insights with AppDynamics, enhancing infrastructure stability through the upgrade from RHEL 7 to 8, and simplifying the deployment process for Wecco. By supporting my team with knowledge transfer on Grok filters, Filebeat, and creating centralized documentation, I foster a culture of shared knowledge and continuous improvement.

Additionally, my work on implementing security principles and simplifying workflows across both departments underscores my focus on reliability, consistency, and client satisfaction. I drive innovation while ensuring the needs of the team and clients are at the forefront, always seeking to enhance collaboration and system performance.
