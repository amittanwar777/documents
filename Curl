Subject: Analysis of Tomcat Restart Behavior Post-Reboot ‚Äì Observations and Improvements

Hi [Team/Recipient],

As part of our review of the Tomcat restart behavior following the recent machine reboot, here is a summary of our findings, current uncertainties, and the improvements being introduced.

‚úÖ What We Observed
-------------------
- The system was rebooted on June 28, which inherently terminated all running processes, including Tomcat and JBoss.
- Upon reboot, the application restart script was triggered. This script includes both a stop and start phase for Tomcat.
- During execution, the logs indicated the presence of stale PID files for several Tomcat instances. These were automatically cleared by Tomcat‚Äôs own `startup.sh` mechanism.
- The Tomcat instances subsequently started successfully, as confirmed by both logs and active process checks.
- JBoss instances were not restarted, as their processes were still active (suggesting no reboot or managed separately).

‚ùì What We're Still Not Fully Sure About
----------------------------------------
- Whether the `stop_tomcat` function is adding value during system boot, since no Tomcat processes are typically running at that point.
- If the stale PID files could cause unintended behavior (e.g. false assumptions, misleading logs) when not handled explicitly.
- If there's any residual risk in the current logic due to process ownership or timing mismatches.

üõ†Ô∏è Improvements Being Made
---------------------------
- The script is being updated to:
  - Check for and validate PID files before trying to stop Tomcat.
  - Safely remove stale PID files only when it's confirmed the associated process is not running.
  - Use loop-based polling instead of fixed sleep to confirm shutdown/startup success more reliably.
  - Enhance logging with timestamps and clearer status reporting.

These changes aim to make the script more robust, reduce false alarms, and improve post-reboot resilience.

Please let me know if you'd like a walkthrough of the updated script or have further concerns to address.
